# Pathfinding Visualizer

A visually interactive and elegant **ReactJS-based Pathfinding Visualizer** that demonstrates how popular pathfinding algorithms explore and find paths in a grid. You can draw walls, visualize each algorithm's behavior, and see the shortest path animation with a futuristic UI.

## Features

- Interactive grid-based visualizer
- Drag to draw/remove walls with mouse
- Fixed start and finish nodes
- Visualize multiple algorithms in real-time
- Reset grid and Reset wall buttons
- Sleek and intuitive user interface built with Material UI, enhanced by elegant micro-interactions for a smooth user experience.

## Algorithms Implemented

-  **Dijkstra's Algorithm** – weighted, guaranteed shortest path
-  **A\*** (A-Star) – weighted, heuristic based
-  **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – unweighted
-  **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – unweighted
